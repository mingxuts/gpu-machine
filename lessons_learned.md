* What are the most important parts in the system for GPU running ?
Answer: the mother board and the power supply unit. For four Nvidia GTX Titan (X or Xp) in the system , I use the power caluator to get one number, it's recommend to have a 1264w power supply unit, but because almost every sydney-based PC supplier out of stock for 1300+ power supply unit. I was forced to pick a 1250w thermal take PSU. Hope it is enough. Then about the motherboard, we pick the top-of the line in Asus mother board but it's atually over kill, and other factory have lower make and cheaper ones. But when we installed it, we found the motherboard is actually worth the dollor.

* Why take the I9 instead of I7-8700k, not others i3 or i5
Answer: because sometimes I run some program that are also CPU instensive. and in the way I can avoid to competing utlize the GPU with others in our group.

* How many memory is good enough?
Answer: hard to say, because GPU needs to exchange data with CPU, and the speed is also a factor to the computing perfomance. A general rule is memory needs to be twice of GPU video memory.
